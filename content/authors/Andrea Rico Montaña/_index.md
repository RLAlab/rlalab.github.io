Hey! My name is Andrea and I’m a Spanish-Colombian PhD student. After completing my MSci in Biotechnology at the University of Glasgow, I moved to Stanford, California, where I worked as a research associate and lab manager.
My PhD research focuses on a key challenge in the commercialization of microbial cell factories: the more we engineer strains, the less robust and more heterogeneous they become. Using _Yarrowia lipolytica_ producing vitamins as a case study, I aim to explore strategies to overcome this bottleneck.  
Beyond the lab, you’ll likely find me dancing Latin music, playing all kinds of sports, or spending time in nature.
