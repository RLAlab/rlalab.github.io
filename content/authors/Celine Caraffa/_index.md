Hi! I'm CÃ©line and I'm a PhD student in the RLA lab after joining from my Biochemistry BSc at Imperial College. My research focuses primarily on engineering yeast to produce dyes and pigments. I am also regularly involved in the European deeptech VC ecosystem.   
In my free time, I enjoy learning languages and like to consider myself a polyglot! My dream is to speak 10 someday.
