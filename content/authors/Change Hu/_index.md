My name is Changyu Hu, and I am from China. I'm currently a fourth-year student in Molecular Bioengineering (MBE) at Imperial College, working on my final year project in the RLA Lab. My project focuses on the production of astaxanthin and zeaxanthin in Yarrowia.  
Outside the lab, I'm an avid table tennis player and enjoy bodybuilding. You'll often find me at Ethos
