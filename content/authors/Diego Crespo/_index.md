Hello! My name is Diego and I am a PhD student from Madrid, Spain working in lignocellulosic biomass degradation and consumption in _Yarrowia lipolytica_.  
I like practicing any kind of sport, so if you are looking for a sport-pal just let me know! Also, I'm always down for both a museum visit and a pub visit â€” both worlds can totally coexist!
