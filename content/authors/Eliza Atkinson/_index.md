Hello! I’m Eliza and I’m an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellowship Research Associate. I’ve been working in the RLA lab for 5 years now. My projects include designing microbial consortia for food waste degradation and precision fermentation for scents and dyes. I am currently working on the production of food proteins in _Yarrowia lipolytica_.  
Outside the lab I spend my time painting, watching horror movies and accidentally murdering my houseplants.
