Hi! I am Giovanni from Lecce, a small town in southern Italy. I joined the RLA lab during my MEng in bioengineering here at Imperial, and decided to stick around for longer for a PhD. Although my research focuses primarily on engineering yeast produce dyes and pigments, I had the chance to work with other organisms, such as the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In 2022, I was also involved with iGEM, leading the “Sporadicate” team in the competition. In my free time I like to boast about my cooking skills, chat about Italian food and lose in chess against Lucas.
