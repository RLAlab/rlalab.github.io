Ciao! Iâ€™m Giorgia and I am from Italy. My research at the RLA lab lies at the intersection of bioengineering, structural biology, and machine learning. My long-term goal is to contribute to creating a circular bio-economy, and I believe synthetic biology is the key to a greener future.  
Outside the lab I enjoy experimenting with new vegan recipes, swimming and hiking and I recently started bouldering!
