Hi! Iâ€™m Hakimi Kassim, a lecturer at Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) in Malaysia. I completed my DPhil at the University of Oxford, where I explored the filamentation of metabolic enzymes in budding yeast under nutrient stress and investigated the biology of extracellular vesicles in breast cancer cells. At the RLA lab, my current work focuses on developing synthetic biology tools for metabolic engineering in _Fusarium venenatum_, aiming to produce valuable chemicals.  
Outside the lab, I enjoy traveling and fishing, which provide opportunities to explore nature and unwind.
