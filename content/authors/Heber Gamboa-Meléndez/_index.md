Hello! I am Heber from Mexico, I have a background in Fungal Genetics, particularly with plant pathogens. I extended my expertise working in Metabolic Engineering to improve fatty acid derivatives yields in _Yarrowia lipolytica_. I’m particularly interested in synthetic microbial communities, adaptive laboratory evolution and bioprocess control to develop robust bioproduction systems in yeast.  
Beside my lab work, I enjoy music, volleyball, running, hiking/trail, and ballet spectacles.
