Hi there, I am Huang Yan, a visiting researcher from Hunan University, China. I specialize in the fields of analytical chemistry and chemical biology, with a particular focus on biosensing and imaging based on functional recombinant proteins, functional DNA and whole cell biosensors. In the RLA lab, I will work with Dr. Cinzia and focus on the evaluation of fluorescent RNA aptamers as fluorescent reporters in yeast. In my free time, I enjoy yoga, hiking and traveling.
