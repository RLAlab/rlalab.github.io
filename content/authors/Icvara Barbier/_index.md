Hello everyone! I am IÃ§vara from Switzerland. I did my PhD on synthetic gene regulatory networks for spatiotemporal formation in _Escherichia coli_ while at Imperial, I work on _Cutibacterium acnes_, a skin bacterium.  
Outside the lab, I like to hang out with people and do sports, mainly martial arts but I also started running and bouldering. I also enjoy a lot being in nature!
