Hi! My name is Jing and I come from China. I worked as a postdoc at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden for almost 4 years. I worked with _Yarrowia lipolytica_ and _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ on value-added products through metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. At Imperial I continue to work with Yarrowia.
