Hi! I'm Juan Felipe from Colombia. I have a background in fermentation, food science and industrial food manufacturing. My research interests focus on understanding and engineering functional properties of food materials to help develop more sustainable food systems. My work in the lab focuses on producing alternative proteins using filamentous fungi grown via solid-state fermentation. I explore how fungal strain engineering and fermentation conditions can be tuned to modify protein functionality, structure, and performance, enabling the development of novel, sustainable food systems.  
Outside the lab, I enjoy cycling, running, outdoor activities, and playing guitar.
