Hi! My name is Julia, and I am from Guatemala. During my MRes, I am working on optimizing the solid-state fermentation and nutritional value of tempeh using microbial and genetic approaches to improve efficiency.  
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, running, and indoor cycling classes, as well as creating science outreach programs to inspire young girls in my community.
