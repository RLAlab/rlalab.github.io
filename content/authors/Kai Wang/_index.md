Hello! I'm Kai Wang from China. My research has long focused on microbial metabolic engineering, specifically targeting efficient conversion of low-carbon compounds. I've worked on fixation of CO2 and formate, as well as biosynthesis of high-value products (such as free fatty acids,terpenoids etc.), primarily using _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ and _Yarrowia lipolytica_. Now, at Imperial, I'm excited to shift my focus to exploring pathways and applications in _Cutibacterium acnes_.  
Besides lab work, I enjoy badminton, tennis, billiards, music and spending time out with friends.
