Hey there! I’m Lisa! Originally from Germany, I’ve been living in the UK for a while now, where I completed my PhD in Cambridge. My research focused on stress pathways in mammalian cells, and I expressed and purified over 100 different proteins for biophysical analysis. Now, I joined the food team at the RLA lab to explore the use of _Yarrowia lipolytica_ for biomass fermentation. I’m passionate about community building — I'm a regional mentor for the Good Food Institute, where I support student groups in the sustainable food tech space.  
To balance all that brain work, I love staying active. You’ll often find me climbing, dancing (5Rhythms and contact improvisation), hiking, or taking a cold water swim.
