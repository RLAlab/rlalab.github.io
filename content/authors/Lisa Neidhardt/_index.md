Hey there! I’m Lisa! Originally from Germany, I’ve been living in the UK for a while now, where I completed my PhD in Cambridge. My research focused on stress pathways in mammalian cells, and I expressed and purified over 100 different proteins for biophysical analysis. Now, I’m joining the food team at the RLA lab to explore the use of Yarrowia lipolytica for biomass fermentation. I’m passionate about community building — I'm a regional mentor for the Good Food Institute, where I support student groups in the sustainable food tech space. To balance all that brain work, I love staying active. You’ll often find me climbing, dancing (5Rhythms and contact improvisation), hiking, or taking a cold water swim.
