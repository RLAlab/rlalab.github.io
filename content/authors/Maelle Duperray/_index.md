Hi, I am Maëlle from France. I am working on phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal yeast populations. I am particularly interested in the mechanisms leading to production heterogeneity and how we could manage it to build more efficient microbial cell factories. I truly believe that biotechnology can contribute to changes towards a more sustainable future and I love talking and learning about all related subjects.  
I also enjoy dancing, cooking, travelling and spending time out with friends.
