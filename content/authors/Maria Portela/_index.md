I am a postgraduate research student in the Microbiome-Microscopy and Microfluidics Lab, co-supervised by Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro. My project focuses on developing microfluidic tools to study the responsiveness and germination dynamics of environmental soil spore communities at the single-cell level. Before starting my PhD I studied Molecular Bioengineering at Imperial, with a year in industry working on single-cell genomics for drug discovery, and completed a Masters project in the RLA lab building and testing ATP biosensors to study metabolic heterogeneity in yeast.
