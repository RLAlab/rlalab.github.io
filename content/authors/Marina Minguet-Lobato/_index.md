Hello! I'm Marina, a postdoctoral researcher from Spain. My research focuses on engineering _Yarrowia lipolytica_ for the development of sustainable bioprocesses aimed at the valorisation of renewable feedstocks. I have a background in biocatalysis and protein engineering, with particular experience working with carbohydrate-active enzymes. I am passionate about applying biotechnology to address environmental challenges.  
Outside of research, I enjoy reading, playing the Spanish guitar, spending time with family and friends, and hanging out with my little black panther, #KarmaTheCat.
