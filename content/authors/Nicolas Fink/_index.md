Hi! I’m Nicolas from Switzerland. I’m passionate about applying biology to build a more sustainable future. In my PhD, I focus on synthetic yeast communities to produce sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). My work involves developing strategies to create syntrophic communities and optimising their performances to create SAFs with enhanced properties.  
Outside the lab, I enjoy spending time outdoors, going on long hikes or to the gym.
