I am originally from Germany and completed my PhD at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. My research focuses on harnessing the oleaginous yeast _Yarrowia lipolytica_ to produce various lipids, particularly food oils. I am passionate about advancing microbial biotechnology to create sustainable solutions for the future of food production.
