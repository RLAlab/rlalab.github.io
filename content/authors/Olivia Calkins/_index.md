Hi! My name is Olivia and I am from Boston, Massachusetts. During my PhD, I am working on developing CRISPR-based tools and AI-driven strain engineering to improve yeast cells as factories for sustainable production of food proteins and other high-value molecules.  
In my free time, I love going on walks, playing board games, and trying new restaurants! I have been vegan for 8 years and that is a big part of why I am so interested in sustainable food research.
