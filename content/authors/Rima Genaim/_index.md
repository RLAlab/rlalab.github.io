Hello, I'm Rima, a postdoctoral researcher. I earned my PhD from Tel Aviv University, where I focused on producing bioplastics using marine microbes. Currently, I'm working on the metabolic engineering of filamentous fungi, particularly Fusarium strains, to enhance biomass and bioproduct production.  
Outside the lab, I'm passionate about music and enjoy playing guitar and piano. I also love playing basketball and tennis - in short, anything that brings fun into my life!
