Hi! I am Sebastián and I am from Chile. I lived 7 years in Spain, where I did my PhD thesis in biotechnology for the first 4 years and then spent a couple years at CNTA research centre (Navarra, Spain) as a researcher. At Imperial, I am working as a research support technician in Bioreactors/Analytics. On my day to day, I execute bioreactors experiments, support the colleagues to design their experiments and carry out HPLC and GC assays.  
In my free time I go climbing, and I like reading books and taking pictures.
