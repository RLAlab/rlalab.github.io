Hello! I’m Shangkun Qiu, a researcher from Zhengzhou, China, passionate about synthetic biology and its potential to drive innovation. My current work focuses on enhancing resveratrol production using engineered _Yarrowia lipolytica_ strains, combining metabolic pathway engineering and bioprocess optimization to maximize yields. I’m deeply convinced that biotechnology holds the key to solving global challenges, and I’m excited to contribute to this transformative field.  
In my leisure time, I enjoy traveling, cooking, reading, and socializing with friends.
