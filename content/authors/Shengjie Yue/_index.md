Hello! I’m Sheng Jie, a postdoctoral researcher from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  My research focuses on employing _Pseudomonas_ to synthesize various valuable compounds. I am expanding my knowledge in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology to tap into the full metabolic potential of _Yarrowia lipolytica_ and _Pseudomonas_. I am particularly interested in synthetic microbiomes, gene editing, and high-throughput screening.  
Outside of my research, I have a passion for music, food, and hiking.
