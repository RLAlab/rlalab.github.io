Hi! I'm Stephanie, a second-year Chemical Engineering student working on developing a food protein database. My project focuses on cataloging and analysing proteins relevant to the food industry, with particular emphasis on their structural characteristics and functional properties. This work aims to create a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals in the alternative protein space.  
Outside of my course, I enjoy hiking scenic trails, getting lost in a good book, and experimenting with new recipes.
