Hi, my name is Qian Tao. I am from China. My research focuses on the development of synthetic biology tools and metabolic engineering, with the aim of producing high-value compounds using _Yarrowia lipolytica_. In Rodrigo’s lab, I will focus on developing and expanding related synthetic biology tools.  
In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and watching movies.
