My name is Tom, and my scientific passions span from C1 metabolism over fungal biology and artificial endosymbiosis to fungal foods. I combine these passions as a Research Fellow and Subgroup Leader in the RLA lab!  
In my free time I enjoy visiting hidden urban places and exploring nature while running absurdly long distances.
