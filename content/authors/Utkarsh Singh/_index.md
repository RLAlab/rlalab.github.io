Hello! I am currently pursuing master's in chemical engineering with biotechnology at Imperial. I did Bachelor's in triple major's (Biotechnology, Chemistry, Zoology) and aspire to pursue my career in Biotechnology. I am working on improving SAF blends using synthetic microbial communities and development of a metabolomic analysis pipeline. In this project my role will be learning about the techniques used and getting hands on experience of lab experiments.
