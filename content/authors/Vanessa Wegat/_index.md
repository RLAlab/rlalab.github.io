Hi! My name is Vanessa and I am a postdoc from Fraunhofer IGB in Straubing, Germany. I worked on synthetic methylotrophic yeast and enzyme engineering during my PhD, and as a visiting researcher at Imperial College, I am building on this work.  
In my free time, I love to travel and meet new people. Besides that, you can count me in for most sports events (running, skiing, hiking, biking, etc.). Iâ€™m a total book nerd and might have read some of my favourite books more than 15 times.
