My name is Wilson, and I am from California. I am a master's student pursuing my MRes in Systems and Synthetic Biology. My research project involves the develop of a genetic toolkit for _Rhizopus microsporus_ to improve the nutritional value and taste of its solid-state fermentation products. By the end of the project, I aim to create ready-to-use tools that will be used for future studies.  
In my free time I enjoy finding new places to skateboard and seeing live music.
