Hi! My name is Yuzhu Zhao. I have a background in food microbial community. My research interests lie in the field of constructing cross-feeding relationships among them. In the lab, my primary focus is on the development of editing tools for _Yarrowia lipolytica_ yeast. This involves exploring innovative techniques to enhance the genetic manipulation of this oleaginous yeast, with the aim of advancing its applications in biotechnology and bioengineering.
